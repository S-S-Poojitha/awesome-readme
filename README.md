# awesome-readme

A command-line app for creating awesome READMEs.

Awesome README was built with speed and simplicity in mind. It enables developers to scaffold a basic README file quickly, reducing setup time and eliminating the need for repetitive manual formatting.

The tool is designed for initial project setup and is not intended for ongoing README updates or maintenance. Its purpose is to jumpstart development by providing a solid starting point, allowing developers to focus on building great software.
